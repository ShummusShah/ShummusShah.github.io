First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Shummus Shah`, a *Financial Professional* and a *Technology Enthusiast* from London, England who loves to write software to build great products
and help business succeed with their goals. 

I was born in Wolverhampton, West Midlands. I hold a Bachelors degree in Accounting and a Masters degree in Finance from the [University of Liverpool][csu-chico]. I have self-taught myself how to code by attending an online coding bootcamp.

I have sought out to teach myself how to code and program and am thoroughly enjoying the journey. I am aspiring to learn, grow and share the knowledge. This is my first real project, I have a lot left to learn in the programming space but I am enjoying the process.


#### I believe in the statement -
> "Programming is limited to your imagination"


# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always on my todo list. I will focus mainly on financial knowledge as that is my area of speciality. For me, this is a fun project to test my programming skills and share my knowledge.

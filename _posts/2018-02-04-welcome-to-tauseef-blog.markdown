First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Shummus Shah`, a *Financial Proffesional* and a *Technology Enthusiast* from Wolverhampton, now living in London.
 
I studied a masters degree in Finance at the [University of Liverpool][csu-chico].

Having extensive knowledge of the financial world, this blog will share my thoughts as well as test my coding ability.

#### I believe in the statement -
> "Necessity is the mother of invention"


# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always on my todo list. As i am learning how to code too, I have put the test my HTML and CSS skills when putting this site together using PyCharm.

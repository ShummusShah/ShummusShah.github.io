First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Shummus Shah`, a *Financial Professional* and a *Technology Enthusiast* originally from Wolverhampton, now living in London. 

I have previously studied a masters degree in Finance as well as a Bachelors degree in Accounting, both of which were obtained at [The University of Liverpool][csu-chico]. I created this blog to share some finance tips and tricks that you may find of use.


#### I believe in the statement -

# What is this site about?
Creating an online presense and to share my learnings was always on my todo list.
I have also started learning how to code so this is a good test of my skill.
